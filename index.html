            <p class="paragraph" id="sb-p">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="sb-p">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="sb-p">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where they both worked as students.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="sb-p">
                Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor") to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="sb-p">
                At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen wrote his next-published novel, originally titled "Second Coming" and then "Jerusalem's Lot", before it became "Salem's Lot", in a small room in the garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age of 59.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="sb-p">
                "Carrie" was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less than a year, during which Stephen wrote "The Shining", set in Colorado. Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished writing "The Stand", much of which also is set in Boulder. "The Dead Zone" was also written in Bridgton.

                <p class="paragraph" style="display: inline;">
                    The Shining" is a horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name. The movie tells the story of Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), a writer who becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the winter season, and his descent into madness as supernatural forces take over the hotel.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Kubrick was known for his meticulous attention to detail and took great care in creating the film's eerie atmosphere. The movie was shot over a period of 13 months at Elstree Studios in England, as well as on location at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon. The Overlook Hotel set was constructed on a soundstage and meticulously designed to be an exact replica of the real-life hotel. The iconic hedge maze, which plays a key role in the movie's climax, was also constructed on a soundstage and designed to be confusing and disorienting.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The film was praised for its cinematography, music, and acting, but it also received some criticism from Stephen King himself for straying too far from the novel's original story.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    "Carrie" is a 1976 horror film directed by Brian De Palma, based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. The movie stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White, a shy and introverted teenage girl who discovers she has telekinetic powers.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The story follows Carrie as she struggles to fit in at school and deal with her abusive and overbearing mother, played by Piper Laurie. When a cruel prank at prom sends Carrie into a violent rage, she unleashes her telekinetic powers and wreaks havoc on the town.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    "Carrie" is known for its iconic prom scene, where Carrie is drenched in pig's blood and seeks revenge on her tormentors. The film also explores themes of bullying, isolation, and the destructive effects of religious fanaticism.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The movie was a critical and commercial success, earning two Academy Award nominations and launching the careers of both Spacek and De Palma. It has since become a classic of the horror genre and is considered one of the best Stephen King adaptations.

            <p class="paragraph">
                In the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year "to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts."
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                King is a fan of baseball, and of the Boston Red Sox in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                After an accident where he was hit by a minivan, King's lawyer and two others purchased the van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he fantasized about smashing it up.
